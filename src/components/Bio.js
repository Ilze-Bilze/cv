  <p>I have more then 10 years of commercial experience.  All I've ever wanted to do is create and I love what I do... I would describe myself as a problem solver, dedicated to creating the best solution for both the client and the viewer whilst meeting current web standards and accessibility. I enjoy the variety of skills that I get to engage in taking a project from initial brief, research and brainstorming, wire framing and mock up through to the build stage using semantic HTML5 and all that CSS 3 has to offer before thoroughly browser testing. I also create responsive sites! I get enormous satisfaction working as part of a team bouncing around ideas and learning from each other, however I am able to work individually to a brief and relish the opportunity to pitch ideas to clients. I am continuously interacting with new industry trends to make sure Iâ€™m at an advanced stage with up and coming movements in the web design arena.</p>
